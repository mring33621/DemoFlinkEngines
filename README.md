# DemoFlinkEngines

Version 1.0

ABOUT:
* This is the Flink Streaming code from my recent [flink/nifi demo](http://www.slideshare.net/mring33/flink-and-nifi-two-stars-in-the-apache-big-data-constellation)
* Recommendation Engine consumes ticks and produces recommended trades
* Execution Engine consumes orders and produces executions
* All this code is pretty much random fake stuff for the demo! There is no useful trading logic to be found here.
* I will shortly provide a separate project with instructions for recreating the full demo locally
* Java 8 compatible.
